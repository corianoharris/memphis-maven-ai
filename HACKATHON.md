## 🎯 Mission

**Beale** is an intelligent AI assistant designed to improve access to Memphis city services (211, 311, and 911) by providing instant, multilingual support 24/7.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Long Wait Times**: Traditional 211/311 call centers experience high call volumes, leading to wait times of 1-3 minutes during peak hours and longer delays during emergencies.

2. **Language Barriers**: Memphis's diverse population (35%+ non-English speakers) faces challenges accessing city services due to language limitations.

3. **Staff Overhead**: City representatives spend significant time answering routine questions that could be automated.

4. **Service Discovery**: Residents struggle to find relevant information quickly, often calling multiple departments or visiting multiple websites.

5. **Limited Availability**: City services operate during business hours, leaving residents without help after hours and on weekends.
