# UX User Story: Adam's Experience with Beale

## As a Memphis Resident

**Background:**
Adam is a busy professional who works long hours and has limited time to deal with city services. When he encounters issues like potholes or needs information about city services, he wants quick, reliable answers without navigating confusing websites or waiting on hold.

**The Problem:**
Adam hit a large pothole while driving to work. He knew he should report it, but:
- He was driving and couldn't safely call 311
- He didn't have time to search the city website during work hours
- He forgot about it by the time he got home
- The next day, he didn't remember how to report it

**Beale's Solution:**
Beale provides instant, 24/7 access to city services through SMS and web chat, making it easy for Adam to get help when and how he needs it.
