## 🌟 The Story: From Frustration to Innovation

### **The Problem Every Memphian Knows**
Picture this: It's 7 AM on a Monday morning. Sarah, a busy working mom, is driving her kids to school when she hits a massive pothole that nearly pops her tire. She knows she needs to report it, but...

- **Call 311?** She's driving and can't safely make a call
- **Visit the website?** She needs to remember the URL and navigate through confusing menus
- **Wait until later?** The pothole will damage more cars, and she'll forget

Meanwhile, across town, Maria, a Spanish-speaking resident, is struggling to understand the garbage collection schedule. She speaks limited English and feels frustrated trying to navigate city services.

**This is the reality for thousands of Memphians every day.**

### **The Vision: Memphis Maven**
What if there was a way to instantly connect residents with the exact information they need, in their language, through the technology they already use?
