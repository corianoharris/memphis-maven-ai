# UX User Story: Stephanie's Experience with Beale

## As a City Services Coordinator

**Background:**
Stephanie is a dedicated city services coordinator who previously spent most of her day answering repetitive questions about basic city services. She handled calls about trash schedules, pothole reporting, and permit information that could be easily found online.

**The Problem:**
Stephanie was overwhelmed by routine inquiries that prevented her from addressing more complex resident needs. She received the same questions daily: "When is trash pickup?", "How do I report a pothole?", "What documents do I need for a permit?"

**Beale's Solution:**
Beale now handles these routine questions automatically through SMS and web chat, allowing Stephanie to focus on challenging cases that require human expertise.
